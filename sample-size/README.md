#### Lee's sample size slider

Lee produced the original version of this widget, and then the group figured out together how to add a slider that adjusts a parameter of the equation.

The final step was learning the need to remove old elements before drawing new ones (previously, new lines were just printed right on top of the existing ones, which got messy.)
